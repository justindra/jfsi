# OpenSearch DDB Zero ETL

This is an example of how to utilize DDBs Zero ETL Integration with OpenSearch to ingest data directly from DynamoDB into OpenSearch.

> Note: This is a managed service by AWS and it is not serverless, hence the cost will be incurred continuously at the minimum OCU, even if no data is being ingested.
